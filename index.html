        <h2>Everyone Has a Story in Life</h2>
        <p>A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted…“Dad, look the trees are going behind!”Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed…“Dad, look the clouds are running with us!”The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man…
        “Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?” The old man smiled and said…“I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.”Every single person on the planet has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.

        <h2>Shake off Your Problems</h2>
        <p>A man’s favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can’t pull it out no matter how hard he tries. He therefore decides to bury it alive.Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it. More soil is poured.It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was grazing in green pastures.After much shaking off (of problems) And stepping up (learning from them), One will graze in GREEN PASTURES.

        <h2>The Elephant Rope</h2>
        <p>As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.

        <h2>A Dish of Ice Cream</h2>
        <p>In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.“How much is an ice cream sundae?”“50 cents,” replied the waitress.The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.“How much is a dish of plain ice cream?” he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was a bit impatient.
        “35 cents,” she said brusquely.The little boy again counted the coins. “I’ll have the plain ice cream,” he said.The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and departed.When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents – her tip.

Sounds like a good deal, right?Unfortunately, not to most of the restaurants. He heard NO over 1000 times. Even after all of those rejections, he didn’t give up. He believed his chicken recipe was something special. He got rejected 1009 times before he heard his first yes.With that one success Colonel Hartland Sanders changed the way Americans eat chicken.

        <h2>The Obstacle in our Path</h2>
        <p>LThere once was a very wealthy and curious king. This king had a huge boulder placed in the middle of a road. Then he hid nearby to see if anyone would try to remove the gigantic rock from the road.The first people to pass by were some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers. Rather than moving it, they simply walked around it. A few loudly blamed the King for not maintaining the roads. Not one of them tried to move the boulder.Finally, a peasant came along. His arms were full of vegetables. When he got near the boulder, rather than simply walking around it as the others had, the peasant put down his load and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. It took a lot of effort but he finally succeeded.The peasant gathered up his load and was ready to go on his way when he say a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The peasant opened the purse. The purse was stuffed full of gold coins and a note from the king. The king’s note said the purse’s gold was a reward for moving the boulder from the road.The king showed the peasant what many of us never understand: every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

        <h2>Value</h2>
        <p>A popular speaker started off a seminar by holding up a $20 bill. A crowd of 200 had gathered to hear him speak. He asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?”200 hands went up.
        He said, “I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this.” He crumpled the bill up.He then asked, “Who still wants it?”All 200 hands were still raised.“Well,” he replied, “What if I do this?” Then he dropped the bill on the ground and stomped on it with his shoes.He picked it up, and showed it to the crowd. The bill was all crumpled and dirty.“Now who still wants it?”All the hands still went up.“My friends, I have just showed you a very important lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, life crumples us and grinds us into the dirt. We make bad decisions or deal with poor circumstances. We feel worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. You are special – Don’t ever forget it!

        <h2>A Very Special Bank Account</h2>
        <p>Imagine you had a bank account that deposited $86,400 each morning. The account carries over no balance from day to day, allows you to keep no cash balance, and every evening cancels whatever part of the amount you had failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every dollar each day!We all have such a bank. Its name is Time. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever time you have failed to use wisely. It carries over no balance from day to day. It allows no overdraft so you can’t borrow against yourself or use more time than you have. Each day, the account starts fresh. Each night, it destroys an unused time. If you fail to use the day’s deposits, it’s your loss and you can’t appeal to get it back.There is never any borrowing time. You can’t take a loan out on your time or against someone else’s. The time you have is the time you have and that is that. Time management is yours to decide how you spend the time, just as with money you decide how you spend the money. It is never the case of us not having enough time to do things, but the case of whether we want to do them and where they fall in our priorities.
